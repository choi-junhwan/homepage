Dear Korean Astronomers in Foreign Country,

My name is Jun-Hwan Choi who will maintain the Korean Astronomers in Foreign Country list.
Since this list has not been updated about five years, I would like to gather your information first.
Please reply this mail or send mail to me (korastro.hotmail.com) for providing your information.
The format of information is the same as previous list which Prof. Im had maintained.

1) Name
2) Position (student? postdoc? faculty?)
3) contact information (current address, e-mail, phone number)
4) time when Ph.D was (or will be) obtained
5) Name of the Ph.D supervisor
6) Topics of research interests

I hope each person provides his/her research topic and this page can be useful for sharing his/her science.
The site is at http://www.physics.unlv.edu/~jhchoi/KorAstro/korastro.html and will be updated upon your information.

The mailing list what I use is based on only list and AAS 221's gathering list and a little more.
Therefore, this list is far from complete.
Please circulate this mail and the URL of the site to any Korean Astronomers who you know.

For person who do not know what it is:
This is the list of Korean Astronomers in Foreign Country to provide basic academic information of Korean astronomers who are conducting their research in foreign countries.

Cheers,
Jun-Hwan Choi

P.S.: If you have any idea about the this site, I welcome your suggestion.
