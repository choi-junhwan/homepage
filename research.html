Currently, two options appear viable in forming the SMBHs at high redshifts: the hierarchical assembly versus a direct collapse. 
We implement the series of idealized numerical simulations to study the gas collapse in the midst of dark matter halos using an AMR code ENZO. 
Our preliminary results show that, under certain conditions, the infaling gas leads to the formation a transient disk-like configuration at the center which is subject to a runaway collapse to very high densities, supplemented by a catastrophic loss of its angular momentum.  
We are carrying on the detail study the physical processeses that play a role on the runaway collapse and trying to apply ro realistic cosmological condition that can make a prediction the formation of the first SMBH.

Using cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations based on the concordance LCDM model, we demonstrate that the Galaxy Stellar Mass Functions (GSMFs) and UV Luminosity Functions (UV LFs) shows very steep low-mass end slopes of (a < -2) for high-z galaxies. 
This finding suggests that the galaxy stellar mass evolution is significantly fast at high-z.
Applying Authentic Radiative Transfer (ART) code to cosmological simulations, we study the escape fraction of the ionizing photon and find that the low mass galaxies play major role on the reionizaition.
We also study the properties of Damped Ly&alpha; system using cosmological simulation and radiative transfer calculation.

Due to the resolution limitation, current cosmological simulations use simplified phenomenological relationships to implement SF and its feedback.
In Choi & Nagamine 2009ab, we are developing improved models in cosmological N-body/Hydrodynamics simulation, GADGET. 
<br>
We implemented metal enrichment, metal cooling, and evolution of mean atomic weight.
Owing to the additional metal cooling, global SFR is enhanced by two different mechanisms; 1) increase of SF efficiency in ISM, and 2) increase of IGM accretion onto galaxies.
The former process is effective throughout most of the cosmic history, while the latter is effective only at $z<3$ when the IGM is sufficiently enriched by metals ow ing to feedback.
Due to the former process, simulated galaxies with metal cooling become more gas poor than without metal cooling.
<br>
We developed a new SF model that takes the effect of molecular hydrogen formation into account.
Comparing with the previous conventional SF model, the new SF models show better agreement with the observations of the Kennicutt law.
Our new model suppresses the early SF and shifts the peak of the cosmic SF history toward low redshift, more consistently with the recent observations.
Our results suggest that there are still rooms left in the model uncertainties to reconcile the discrepancy that was found between the theory and observations of cosmic SF history and stellar mass development.
We also tested the effect of cosmological parameters on the cosmic SF history, and found that changes in cosmological parameters mostly affect the amplitude of the cosmic SF history.
The SFR is sensitive to the cosmological parameters that control the primordial power spectrum at high redshifts, while the cosmic matter content becomes important at lower redshifts.

Recent observations show that the galactic outflows are observed in three forms: hot X-ray winds, warm-ionized winds, and cold winds detected in absorption lines.
These outflows have different characteristics such as temperatures, wind velocities and mass loading factors. 
In order to capture these complicated properties, we have developed a new wind model which reproduces multiphase outflows with variable wind speed depending on the galaxy SFR.
The new wind model does not overheats IGM, while significantly suppresses SFR and spreads metals into IGM, because large fractions of galactic winds in this model are warm and cold gas and contain considerable metals.

<font color="#000033" size=5> Resonant dynamics in dark matter halo and satellite interaction </font><br>
<font color="#003300" size=4><em> <i>with</i> Martin D. Weinberg, Neal Katz (UMass) </em><br></font>
<ul>
Interactions between bar-dark matter halo and satellite-primary galaxy play an important role in explaining observed present day galaxy characteristics.
Galaxy evolution by these interactions mostly occurs through resonance coupling of orbits. 
Current N-body simulations are possibly inadequate to resolve the appropriate resonant dynamics, resonant dynamics is easily distorted or erased by astronomically unrealistic noise sources, such as Poisson noise and two-body relaxation (Weinberg & Katz 2007ab).
Failure of reproducing resonant dynamics in N-body simulation possibly causes (or enhances) the "small scale" CDM crises.
We are investigating galaxy evolution due to satellite-dark matter halo interaction in detail using both state-of-the-art N-body simulations and linear perturbation theory calculation to determine the validity of the simulation and to understand what processes really drive galaxy evolution.
According to our study, the resonant dynamics plays an important role in galaxy evolution.
First, the resonant interaction significantly changes satellite decay rate.
Second, the resonant heating is important mechanism in satellite disruption. 
We find the resonant torque, the angular momentum transfer from time dependent host halo potential to satellite particles, enhances satellite mass loss.
Third, we expect that owing to global excitation by resonant interaction, the satellite halo interaction can cause the halo cusp evolution.
